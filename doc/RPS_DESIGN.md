# Simulation Design Final

### High level design

For our implementation we would create a general game element class 
from which the various rock, paper etc.. elements could be created. Each
element would receive its own name and description from the text file. In 
this way, new game modes could be added easily. Furthermore, we would 
create both a game logic class to do the comparisons between game elements
and a general game runner.
